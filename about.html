          Payment Service Providersâ€™ Association of Nepal is a not-for-profit,
          independent, umbrella organisation formed by the combined efforts of
          (PSPs), digital wallets of Nepal. We are committed to building a
          strong, united community of payment service providers through
          cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and a shared vision for the digital
          future. Our focus lies in upholding the advocacy for our members while
          promoting access to technology and innovation. We work closely with
          government bodies and stakeholders to provide policy input, regulatory
          feedback, and technical insights that help shape a fair and inclusive
          digital financial environment. We also prioritise fostering a culture
          of continuous learning by organising know-how sharing sessions,
          workshops, and events that keep members updated on the latest trends
          and technologies in digital finance. By empowering our members with
          knowledge and skills, we help them stay relevant in a rapidly digital
          landscape.
